Hello!

This set of trial pre-processing scripts and functions assumes exported files from Vicon Nexus 2.X, including TRC, MOT (ground reaction force) and MOT (EMG) files.

The primary script is "PrepareTrialFromVicon" which calls all the others.

Happy Processing!

There is some hard coding in the main script, but as long as you've read through it and have customised it to your data, it should work fine.
