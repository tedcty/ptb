Hello!

This set of scripts and functions assumes output files from OpenSim including MOT (IK Results) and STO (ID Results) files. 

The main script is PrepareDataAcrossParticipantsFull, which calls all the others.

There is some hard coding in the main function, but as long as you read through it and customise it for your usage, it should work fine.
